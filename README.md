# **Trip Planning Agent using CrewAI**  

## **Introduction**  
The **Trip Planner Agent** is a powerful tool built on top of the **CrewAI** framework, designed to assist travelers in planning and scheduling their trips. This project showcases how CrewAI automates the decision-making process when travelers are uncertain about their destination choices. By leveraging a team of autonomous AI agents, CrewAI enables seamless collaboration to analyze different options and generate an optimized travel itinerary tailored to user preferences.  

## **CrewAI Framework**  
CrewAI is designed to facilitate intelligent collaboration between role-based AI agents. In this project, these agents work together to assess various cities, compare travel conditions, and craft a well-structured itinerary that aligns with the traveler's preferences and budget.  

## **Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.8 or later  
- Access to **GPT-4o-mini** (default model used)  
- OpenAI API key  
- Required dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This script defaults to **GPT-4o-mini** unless modified, which may incur usage costs.
